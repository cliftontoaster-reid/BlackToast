# Black Toast

**Black Toast** is *probably* an alternative to Reddit that aims to operate in a peer-to-peer fashion.
It will hopefully, after a lot of work, support everything Reddit supports. For now, it is an idea on paper, made by a furry.

I hope it will grow; maybe I'll have a little team. That would be great. Anyway, I love you all and will be right back. I have to work on that now.

## Details

Also, if you wonder, I will be using Rust as programming language, `libp2p` for the communication, and scylladb as database.

I will also be using TOML as data representation instead of JSON, this is a personal choice, I may change it later but for now there is no chance of that happening.
